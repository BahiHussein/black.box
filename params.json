  "body": "# about\r\nblack.box is a small subscription-based Wi-Fi policy routing VPN appliance, which runs on a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi).\r\n\r\nDevices connected to the `black.box` Wi-Fi network, can access geo-restricted Internet content, such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer in various geographic regions.\r\n\r\nA subscription is required to activate the device. This service is offered on a rolling subscription basis, with **1 moth free trial**. Afterwards a monthly subscription fee applies, unless the subscription is [cancelled](#cancellation) prior to the next billing cycle.\r\n\r\nThe software uses a list of DNS domain names[[n1](#footnotes)] and IPv4/IPv6 subnets/IPs[[n2](#footnotes)], which are routed via the tunnel interface, while all the remaining traffic flows via the local Internet interface. The tunnel interface only allows specific network ports[[n3](#footnotes)], while the local Internet interface in unrestricted. All other traffic is blocked on the tunnel interface.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------+         +-----------------+\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |                 |  google.com, etc.\r\n|   iOS   | +-----> |    black.box    | +---------------->\r\n|         |         |    ---------    |\r\n+---------+         |    VPN policy   |\r\n                    |    router       |\r\n+---------+         |                 |\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |                 |\r\n| Windows | +-----> |                 |\r\n|         |         |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |\r\n                    |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |         +--------+\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |   netflix.com   |   VPN   |        |\r\n|  OS X   | +-----> |   nflxvideo.net | +-----> | VPN US +----+\r\n|         |         |   hulu.com      |         |        |    |\r\n+---------+         +-----------------+         +----+---+ UK |\r\n                                                     |        |\r\n                                                     +--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n# instructions\r\n1. obtain a Rasberry Pi 3 with a SD card (4GB+) and download and install [Etcher](http://www.etcher.io/)\r\n2. download the [.img](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/belodetech/resin-rpi3-1.16.0-2.3.0-46c05b958e51.img) file, burn it to the SD card with `Etcher`, then insert the card into the Pi\r\n3. connect the Pi to the Internet using a spare Ethernet port on your router (power using an adapter, not USB port)[[n6](#footnotes)]\r\n5. after a few minutes, connect to a new Wi-Fi network called `black.box` (passphrase: `blackbox`)\r\n6. visit [http://blackbox/](http://blackbox/), click subscribe to setup up a PayPal billing agreement and claim your **1 month free** trial\r\n7. once subscribed, you will be redirected back to the [dashboard](#dashboard)[[n5](#footnotes)]\r\n8. after a few minutes, your device will finish updating and unblock the default region[[n4](#footnotes)]\r\n9. for issues, please contact [support](mailto:blackbox@belodedenko.me)\r\n\r\n# dashboard\r\nThe device dashboard is accessible by navigating to [black.box](http://blackbox/) while connected to the `black.box` Wi-Fi network.\r\n\r\n![black.box dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/black.box/master/images/dashboard.png)\r\n\r\n# other regions\r\n`United States` and `United Kingdom` are currently suported regions.\r\n\r\nTo change the default region[[n4](#footnotes)], click the appropriate flag on the [dashboard](#dashboard)[[n5](#footnotes)].\r\n\r\n# cancellation\r\nPlease visit PayPal to cancel your `black.box` subscription.\r\n\r\n![PayPal cancel subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/black.box/master/images/paypal.png)\r\n\r\n#### footnotes\r\n1. default domain list: `netflix.com`, `nflxvideo.net` and `hulu.com`\r\n2. default ASNs: `AS2906`\r\n3. default ports: `80/tcp`, `443/tcp` and `53/udp`\r\n4. default region: `United States`\r\n5.
