  "body": "# about\r\nblack.box is a proprietary plug-and-play, peer-to-peer VPN policy routing sofware, which runs on a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) hardware device. This service is not designed for privacy and/or anonymity since it uses OpenVPN as the tunnel transport protocol, without encryption.\r\n\r\nThe software uses a list of DNS domain names[[n1](#footnotes)] and IPv4/IPv6 subnets/IPs[[n2](#footnotes)], which are routed via the tunnel interface, while all the remaining traffic flows via the local Internet interface. The tunnel interface only allows specific network ports[[n3](#footnotes)], while the local interface in unrestricted. All other traffic is blocked on the tunnel interface.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------+         +-----------------+\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |                 |  google.com, etc.\r\n|   iOS   | +-----> |    black.box    | +---------------->\r\n|         |         |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |\r\n                    |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |                 |\r\n| Windows | +-----> |                 |\r\n|         |         |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |\r\n                    |                 |\r\n+---------+         |                 |         +--------+\r\n|         |  Wi-Fi  |                 |   VPN   |        |\r\n|  OS X   | +-----> |                 | +-----> | VPN US +----+\r\n|         |         |                 |         |        |    |\r\n+---------+         +-----------------+         +----+---+ UK |\r\n                                                     |        |\r\n                                                     +--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nA [subscription](#subscription) is required to activate the device.
